# Team Members

* Isaac Cheung - assistant programmer (thanks for doing the tedious stuff)

# Approach 
* Distributed Jobs
* Organize our objectives and stories in a seperate document
* We used IF statements to keep track of which story and which variables to use
* randomly selected story to use through arraylist
* arraylists also used to collect inputs

# Challenges 
* Absent workers 
* pronouns in array list
* Re-using the same variables
* none of these ever were solved ðŸ˜­
