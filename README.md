# Madlib
A madlibs project for Skyline HS Utah 

[Source Code](https://github.com/fugu2000/madlib/tree/main/src)

# Team Members
* Marcus Nishikawa - lead programmer (most of the logic)
* Tiger Yang - story maker & tester
* Franklin Chia - main programmer (the tedious stuff and telling isaac to do the tedious stuff)
* Isaac Cheung - assistant programmer (thanks for doing the tedious stuff)
* Shengbin Yang - story maker
* Margot Zollinger - story maker

# Approach 
* Distributed Jobs
* Organize our objectives and stories in a seperate document
* We used IF statements to keep track of which story and which variables to use
* randomly selected story to use through arraylist
* arraylists also used to collect inputs

# Challenges 
* Absent workers 
* pronouns in array list (just reusing it was hard)
* Re-using the same variables (storing these were never figured out)
* none of these ever were solved ðŸ˜­
