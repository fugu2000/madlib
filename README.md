# Approach 
* Distributed Jobs
* Organize our objectives and stories in a seperate document
* We used IF statements to randomizing the stories
* randomly selected story to use through arraylist
* arraylists also used to collect inputs

# Challenges 
* Absent workers 
* pronouns in array list (just reusing it was hard)
* Re-using the same variables (storing these were never figured out)
* Fine tuning the stories
